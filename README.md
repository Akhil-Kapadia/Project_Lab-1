# Project_Lab-1

Collabs: Akhil K., Alejadro H., Shawn I.

This is primarily only for the code we will develope in lab.
As such, I have some rules to follow and will include instructions here.

RULES:
DO NOT DIRECTLY UPLOAD TO GITHUB! (Without asking first, this messes up git a lil bit)
When making a commit, Make your comment informational, include changes to files commited.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Getting Started (1st time):
1	Goto an empty folder (ie "Project Lab 1")
2	Right click and select "Git bash Here"
3	Enter "git clone https://github.com/Akhil-Kapadia/Project_Lab-1.git" (Without "")
4	This will create the current repo in a new folder inside your project lab folder. Go ahead and close git, 
and open the "Project_Lab-1" folder. Right click and open git bash again.
5	You are now in the shared repo. Edit files here using Vivado or whatever.

SAVING YOUR CHANGES:
(Assuming git's already open in the repo) 
1	You'll need to "commit" the changes. What this does is it record the changes you've made. ie old file - new file = changes.
This doesn't upload anything though, it just tells git what changes need to be uploaded.
Enter "git commit fileName.type
